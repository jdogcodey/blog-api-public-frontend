# This project was following the Blog API on The Odin Project

I have decided to abandon it - at least for the moment. I didn't really look back at the brief and so hadn't noticed how far I had drifted from that vision. I don't need the profile page, I just need the posts to appear on the homepage, I also don't necessarily need the ability for people to log in (at least on this front end) because it's not in the brief for this to be the case. 

Lesson learnt - read the brief properly. I can definitely remake this project fairly easily in future. However, I have learnt the skills from this project now and so will move on and revisit if I have a good chunk of time in future.
